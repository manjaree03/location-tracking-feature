Developed a Location Tracking Feature using Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, Thymeleaf, and Google Maps API, enabling user-wise location history visualization with time spent analysis. Integrated an Android Background Location Service with Activity Recognition that dynamically adjusts tracking intervals based on user activity (Still, Walk, Run, Vehicle) to optimize performance and battery consumption.
